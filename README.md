"BCIT Bathroom Buddy"

A PHP-based web-application created during the BCIT 2018 30-hour Hackathon.

For this Hackathon, teams of 4-5 members from the BCIT Co-op program had to solve the topic of "As a BCIT Student, I want _______, so that ______"

Our team, the Bathroom Buddies (Team #10), decided that as BCIT Students, we wanted to know what bathrooms are available in any given BCIT building and if it has the qualities we want so that we can feel comfortable doing our business.

People have different preferences and criteria for suitable washrooms and we want our users to know where they can find one they would use.  Our solution was to provide a catalogue of bathrooms in BCIT complete with location and quality ratings to provide information to users.  The ratings include smell, cleanliness, and traffic.

The value this app adds is that it gives users the knowledge of where the bathrooms are so they can quickly navigate to it in emergencies, and also know which washrooms they want to avoid and which are suitable to their own preferences.  Users are also able to add new washroom entries to the catalogue so that they can update the application with the latest information in real time.

This application was developed by Wilburt Herrera, Alex Lee, Harmon Minhas, and Rys Rabang
